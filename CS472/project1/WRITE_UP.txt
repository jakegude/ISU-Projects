1) 	my 3rd heuristic is just finding the minimum number of either the manhattan distance or the mismatched tiles.
	This is an admissible heuristic because both finding the manhattan distance and finding the number mismatched
	tiles are admissible heuristics so when choosing the minimum number of those 2 would also be admissible.
